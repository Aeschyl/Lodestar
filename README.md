## How to use

The user is welcomed by a splash screen and led through easy to understand and interactive screens in the app that let them apply the filters they require to search for attractions nearby. Eventually they reach the final screen which displays the results on a map. The user can click on a marker on the map to know more about the place.

## Tools used

This application implements C# (WPF Framework) language for the frontend component and uses python for the backend.

It makes calls to Places API provided by Geoapify to return the required results of various different attractions. [Places API](https://www.geoapify.com/places-api)
