OR LIABILITY, DENY ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SITE (INCLUDING
BLOCKING CERTAIN IP ADDRESSES), TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY REASON OR

13. GOVERNING LAW
These Terms of Use and your use of the Site are governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado applicable to agreements made
and to be entirely performed within the State of Colorado, without regard to its conflict
of law principles.
14. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
Informal Negotiations
To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim
related to these Terms of Use (each "Dispute" and collectively, the “Disputes”)
brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the
Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes
expressly provided below) informally for at least 90 days before initiating
arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party
to the other Party.
Binding Arbitration
If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the
Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and
exclusively resolved through binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT
AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted
under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association
("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer
Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA
website: www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation
shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by
the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the
submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in
writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either
Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if
the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA
rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in United States, Colorado.
Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel
arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or
enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall
be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in United
States, Colorado, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack
of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and
jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform
Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) is excluded from these Terms of Use.
In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be
commenced more than one (1) years after the cause of action arose. If this provision
is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any
Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or
unenforceable, and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent
jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to
submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
Restrictions
The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the
Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be
joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to
be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c)
there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported
representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration
The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions
concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to
enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights
of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy,
invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this
provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to
arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or
unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction
within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the
personal jurisdiction of that court.
15. CORRECTIONS
There may be information on the Site that contains typographical errors,
inaccuracies, or omissions, including descriptions, pricing, availability, and various
other information. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies, or
omissions and to change or update the information on the Site at any time, without
